When you run the following code, you get the following error message:

def equal_to_four(x)
  if x == 4
    puts "yup"
  else 
    puts "nope"
end

equal_to_four(5)


=> test_code.rb:96: syntax error, unexpected end-of-output, expecting keyword
   _end


-- Answer

This error message is stating that on line 96 of the program "test_code.rb"
there is an error, with that error being a missing closing "end" for the "if"
statement within the defined method. There should be a closing "end" statement
for both the "if" conditional, and the defining method. Corrected code below:


def equal_to_four(x)
  if x == 4
    puts "yup"
  else 
    puts "nope"
  end
end

equal_to_four(5)
