Given the following code...

x = "hi there"
my_hash = {x: "some value"}
my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}

What's the difference between the two hashes that were created?

-- Answer

The first hash utilizes the new method of writing a hash in ruby as of version
1.9 or later. It uses a symbold as a key. The second hash uses the old method of writing a hash which
cooresponds to ruby versions 1.9 and earlier. It uses the string value of
the x variable as the key.
