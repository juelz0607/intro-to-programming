Look at the following programs...

x = 0

3.times do 
  x += 1
end
  
puts x


y = 0

3.times do 
  y+= 1
  x = y
end

puts x


What does x print to the screen in each case? Do they both give errors?
Are the errors different? Why?

-- In the first exercise, x would print 3. In the second exercise, 
printing x would result in an error because the variable "x" was created
within a method, therefore would not be accessible outside of that
method.
