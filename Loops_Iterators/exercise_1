What does the "each" method in the following program return after it is finished 
executing?

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

x.each do |a|
  a +1 
end 


-- Answer

=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] because the expression within the .each method isn't printing
anything to screen with the expression it is given, therefor the method returns 
what it was originally called upon.
