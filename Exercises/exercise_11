After looking at many Rails/Ruby online API sources, I have taken a liking to 
Emil Soman's "Building tested, documented, and versioned JSON API using Rails 4.
(http://www.emilsoman.com/blog/2013/05/18/building-a-tested/)

I've not only found it easy to read through, but the patience expressed within
the content allows for applicable understanding of the information provided.
