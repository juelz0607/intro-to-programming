# What do the following expressions evaluate to?

1. x = 2

2. puts x = 2

3. p name = "Joe"

4. four = "four"

5. print something = "nothing"


# Answers. 

1) returns 2

2) nil, because after x is evaluated to 2, puts returns nil. 

3) prints "Joe" with quotation marks included.

4) returns the string "four".

5) nil, because the variable "something" cannot be declared on the same line as 
it's being called on.
