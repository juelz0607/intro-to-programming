# Write a program that iterates over an array and builds a new array that is the 
# result of incrementing each value in the original array by a value of 2. You
# should have two arrays at the end of this program, the original array and the
# new array you've created. Print both arrays to the screen using the p method
# instead of puts. 


a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
c = []

a.each { |x| c.push(x+2) }

p c
